A project to decrypt the ciphertext using the Vigenere cipher based on the Caesar cipher.
"The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers,
based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution."

The solution is in the VigenereBreaker class.
After running the main:
First you need to choose what message you want to decrypt (all texts in VigenereTestData directory).
After that you need to choose all languages in directory "dictionaries".
