Implementation of a small text editor. The structure of the project and
the implementation of the layout of the main window by UCSD MOOC Team.
All the basic methods, such as spell checking, autocomplete,
writing similar text using the Markov generator, were done by me.

Spell checking is implemented in two ways using a linked list and a B-tree.
Autocomplete is realized using a prefix tree.

Application launch: src/application/MainApp

You can enable spell checking and autocomplete.
You can change the index for autocomplete if the index is 1,
autocomplete will only show words with 1 change from the original word.
